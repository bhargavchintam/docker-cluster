# docker-cluster
Trial for creating docker cluster images

## How to use
1. To clone repository to your local - `git clone <link>`
2. To navigate to repo folder - `cd docker-cluster`
3. To build docker cluster - `docker-compose build`
4. To run the cluster `docker-compose up`
5. To terminate cluster `docker-compose down` or `Ctrl+C`

## Note:
Steps 1 to 4 will create an docker cluster to create images and run those images.
Here, we need to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to as create the multiple docker images.

This should run 2 python scripts.
